A very basic sign up form designed after a reference image for The Odin Project.

Not an actually properly functioning form, mostly useful for getting used to building forms and getting some practice in styling them, as well as implementing basic client-side validation.

The password and confirm password fields are validated using JavaScript, the rest are validated with HTML.
